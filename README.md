InterBase Driver for Python is a [Python](http://python.org) library package that implements
[Python Database API 2.0](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/)-compliant support for
the Embarcadero SQL Database
[InterBase](http://www.firebirdsql.org) Â®. In addition to the minimal
feature set of the standard Python DB API, Interbase Driver for Python also exposes the entire
native (old-style) client API of the database engine. Notably:

  - Automatic data conversion from strings on input.
  - Automatic input/output conversions of textual data between UNICODE
    and database character sets.
  - Support for prepared SQL statements.
  - Multiple independent transactions per single connection.
    access specifications.
  - Distributed transactions.
